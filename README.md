# Unlocked website

The landing page and website for the Unlocked component library and compositions.

The website features information regarding the product as well as a range of available component compositions that utilise the atomic components provided in [@unlocked/base](https://www.github.com/UnlockedUI/unlocked-ui).

## ðŸš€ Next steps
I'll be looking to explore a better development environment and deployment process regarding the compositional components. This will most likely take the form of either a monorepo, allowing for a tighter scope & improved developer experience or a seperate package.

## ðŸ”§ Development & maintenance

### Commit style
Commit messages must conform to the to the [conventional commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

```bash 
type(scope?): subject  # e.g app or comp
```

Message types:
- chore
- feat
- fix
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test
