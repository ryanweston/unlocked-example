        Unlocked is a forward thinking, modern Tailwind based atomic component library built for Vue3. We intend to
        innovate to tackle the lack of control you have when using other large components libraries and mitigate the tradeoffs of using them.

        Why build Unlocked?
      </u-subtitle>
      <u-body class="py-2 text-textTwo">
        Unlocked was built with the aim to help provide you with the benefits of using a component library, while also giving you more control and customisation options. This is particularly helpful when you want to scale your product into a design system!

        How do you intend on doing this?
      </u-subtitle>
      <u-body class="py-2 text-textTwo">
        We follow the atomic design methodology and wrap headless UI components as atomic base components to provide you with the utility you expect from a component library. Our theming system can be completely controlled by you, allowing you to customise these components with ease.
        We then seperate molecules and organisms into our own
        <u-link href="/compositions">
          compositional components.
        </u-link>. These are components, inspired by TailwindUI and built with Unlocked base components, to help fast track your projects with more control over complex components.
